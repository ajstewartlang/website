I am a Professor at the University of Manchester with research interests in cognitive science, data visualisation, open science, and reproducible research. I am the Institutional Lead for Open and Reproducible Research and have a joint appointment in Psychology and Computer Science - where I am a member of the [eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/). 

My current research projects examine how people understand data visualisations, how readers understand meaning that is implied by a linguistic utterance (rather than that which is conveyed explicitly), the mechanisms by which conditional information is processed and represented, and (more generally) how meaning is integrated across sentences.  

I teach data science and statistical methods to students in Psychology and Biological Sciences with an emphasis on R, Python, open source tools, open research, and reproducibility.
