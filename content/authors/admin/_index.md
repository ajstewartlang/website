I am Professor in Experimental Psychology at the University of Manchester with research interests in experimental psychology, open science, and reproducible research. I am the Institutional Lead for Open and Reproducible Research and have a joint appointment in Psychology and Computer Science. 

My current research projects examine how people understand data visualisations, how readers understand meaning that is implied by a linguistic utterance (rather than that which is conveyed explicitly), the mechanisms by which conditional information is processed and mentally represented, and (more generally) how meaning is integrated across sentences.  

I teach data science and statistical methods to students in Psychology and Biological Sciences with an emphasis on R, open research, and reproducibility.
