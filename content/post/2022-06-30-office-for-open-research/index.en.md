In April 2022 the University of Manchester launched the [Office for Open Research](https://www.openresearch.manchester.ac.uk/). Led by the library, the office supports the University's aims to create a more open and responsible research environment. As institutional lead for open and reproducible research, I work closely with Scott and his team in the library on all aspects of open research, including ensuring that University processes are aligned with our [open research position statement](https://www.openresearch.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/position-statement/). We have an active network of open research advocates at the University of Manchester, and if you'd like to join this network you can subscribe to our emailing list [here](https://listserv.manchester.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=open_research&A=1).
